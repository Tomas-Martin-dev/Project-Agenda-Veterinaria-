## Description  
This project is a js practice, applying topics such as...  *-Prototypes -LocalStorage -indexedDB -DOM -CRUD*  
I was inspired to do this project by my sister, she is a veterinarian, she writes down her clients in a notebook, so I decided to stop using so much paper...  

## Project status  
This project is already usable but it is far from finished. New fields will be added soon and the design will be improved to make it mobile-friendly. Any feedback will be welcome to continue improving my code  and gain knowledge!!
